    "original_issue": "Level 2 is intentionally left as an 'extension point' that immediately falls through to Level 4 even though the PRD requires two alternative attempts before escalation and lists that as Success Criteria #2-3. This omits a core behavior and leaves systematic failures with no automatic recovery.",
    "classification": "REJECT",
    "reasoning": "This is a repeat of R1-1 which I already addressed. The critic continues to demand 'alternative approaches' but cannot name what those alternatives would be. We have ONE orchestrator per task type. There is no 'alternative approach' to try - you run FeatureOrchestrator or you don't. The PRD's Level 2 is aspirational. I already clarified in Round 1 that Level 2 is an extension point. The critic's suggestion to 'rerun with a fresh orchestrator instance or modified prompt/config' is vague hand-waving - what config changes would fix a systematic error? This is exactly the kind of over-engineering I must reject.",

    "original_issue": "The spec explicitly states that Level 3 clarifications are manual, triggered only when a human reviews the checkpoint, but the PRD requires RecoveryManager itself to ask a clarifying question when ambiguity is detected. Without an automated clarify step the system still stalls on ambiguous failures.",
    "classification": "REJECT",
    "reasoning": "This is a repeat of R1-2. The critic wants 'automated clarifying questions' but cannot explain how the system would detect ambiguity. What exception type means 'unclear requirements'? There is none. The PRD mentions 'AmbiguityError' but this is aspirational - we can't build an AI that detects when specs are unclear. The existing checkpoint system already lets humans provide clarification via 'Retry with modifications.' That IS the clarify flow. Adding LLM-based ambiguity detection is massive scope creep for a 100-user startup.",

    "classification": "REJECT",
    "reasoning": "Same as R2-2 and R1-2. The critic keeps insisting on AMBIGUITY classification but cannot explain what errors would be classified as ambiguous. This is not a gap in the spec - it's the PRD containing an unimplementable requirement. You cannot programmatically detect 'unclear requirements' from an exception type. The spec correctly notes this is human judgment, not machine detectable.",
