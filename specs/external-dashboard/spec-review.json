    "Spec stays scoped exactly to the PRD requirements without fluff",

  "summary": "Spec is lean, clear, and directly maps to the PRD. It keeps scope tight to the three required metrics, reuses existing data sources, avoids any new infrastructure, and lays out a straightforward plan with basic error handling and tests. No changes needed.",
