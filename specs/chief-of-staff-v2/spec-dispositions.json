    "classification": "REJECT",
    "reasoning": "Previously addressed in R1-2. The PRD itself ranked parallel execution as P6 (7\u00d76=42) - near the bottom of priorities. Jerry Liu explicitly warned against premature parallelism: 'You CANNOT parallelize changes to the same file, dependent PRs.' We're a startup with one developer. Sequential campaign execution covers 95% of use cases. The critic is pushing enterprise patterns that add massive complexity for minimal benefit at our scale.",

Multi-day campaigns (P4) already provide forward-looking planning. Weekly planning is a thin UI/UX wrapper over campaign data that adds zero core functionality.

    "reasoning": "The critic has a valid point about complexity, but the core 4-level recovery structure is sound (it's from the expert panel).

We can add embeddings when retrieval quality becomes a real problem. Removing embedding infrastructure simplifies Phase 9 significantly.",
