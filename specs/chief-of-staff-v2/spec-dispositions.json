    "classification": "REJECT",
    "reasoning": "Previously addressed in R1-4. The expert panel ranked parallel execution P6 (below our P1-P5 scope), and Jerry Liu explicitly warned 'Be careful with parallelism in codebases.' We have ONE developer using this tool. Sequential campaigns cover 95% of use cases. Adding branch coordination, conflict detection, and parallel scheduling is significant complexity for startup scale. The critic continues to push enterprise patterns against expert panel guidance. We'll add it in v3 when we have real demand.",

This is not over-engineering\u2014it's completing the P0 checkpoint requirement we already committed to. Simple fix: add hiccup detection based on error counters and recovery level.",
