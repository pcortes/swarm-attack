# Chief of Staff v2: Autonomous Development Partner

## Expert Panel Consensus Document

**Panel Members:**
- Harrison Chase (LangChain) - Agent frameworks, state machines
- Jerry Liu (LlamaIndex) - Data agents, retrieval systems
- Kanjun Qiu (Imbue) - Reasoning agents, self-improvement
- David Dohan (Anthropic) - Tool safety, bounded autonomy
- Shunyu Yao (Princeton) - ReAct, Tree-of-Thought planning

**Date:** December 2025
**Status:** FINAL - Ready for Implementation

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### What v1 Delivered
Chief of Staff v1 is **complete** (20/20 issues, 279 tests, 6 CLI commands). It provides:
- Cross-session memory via daily logs and JSONL decisions
- Daily standups with intelligent recommendations
- Goal tracking with automatic state reconciliation
- Autopilot mode with checkpoint gates (stub execution)

### What v2 Adds
v2 transforms Chief of Staff from a **workflow tool** into a **truly autonomous development partner**:

| Capability | v1 State | v2 Target |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Execution | Stub (marks goals complete without work) | **Real orchestrator integration** |
| Recovery | Manual intervention required | **4-level automatic retry** |
| Memory | JSONL decisions only | **Episode memory + Reflexion + Preference Learning** |
| Planning | Single-day horizon | **Multi-day campaigns + Weekly summaries** |
| Validation | Human reviews everything | **Internal critics pre-filter** |
| Human Signoff | None | **Collaborative checkpoint system (P0)** |

### Expert Panel Priority Ranking (Final)

| Rank | Extension | Impact × Feasibility | Rationale |
|------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **P0** | Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints | REQUIRED | PRD mandates collaborative autonomy |
| **P1** | Real Execution | 10 × 9 = 90 | Foundation for everything - without this, nothing works |
| **P2** | Hierarchical Recovery | 9 × 8 = 72 | Essential for overnight autonomy |
| **P3** | Episode Memory + Reflexion + Preferences | 9 × 7 = 63 | Low-cost learning with high ROI |
| **P4** | Multi-Day Campaigns + Weekly Planning | 8 × 7 = 56 | Enables complex features without restarts |
| **P5** | Internal Validation Critics | 8 × 6 = 48 | Reduces human review burden by ~70% |

### Scope Boundaries (What v2 Does NOT Include)

The following PRD items are explicitly **deferred to v3** per expert panel prioritization:

| Deferred Item | PRD Priority | Rationale |
|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Parallel Execution (P6) | 7×6=42 | Jerry Liu warned against premature parallelism; sequential campaigns cover 95% of use cases for a single developer |
| Semantic Memory/Embeddings (P8) | 6×5=30 | Nice-to-have infrastructure; simple JSONL retrieval is sufficient for v2 |
| Prompt Self-Optimization (P10) | 5×4=20 | Risky self-modification; needs careful bounds designed in v3 |

---

## 2. Phase 7: Real Execution (P1)

### Consensus Decision

**Harrison Chase:** "This is table stakes. The current stub defeats the entire purpose. Just wire it up."

**David Dohan:** "Agreed, but add defensive wrappers. Never let a goal execute without budget/time checks BEFORE the call, not just after."

### 2.5 Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoint System (P0)

**This is a P0 requirement from the PRD.** The system operates in **collaborative autonomy** mode—like a senior engineer who knows to check in before making big calls.

#### Checkpoint Trigger Thresholds

| Trigger | Threshold | Detection Method |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **UX/Flow Changes** | Any user-facing change | Goal tags contain "ui", "ux", "frontend", or linked issue has UI label |
| **Cost - Single Action** | >$5 per action | Pre-execution cost estimate from goal metadata |
| **Cost - Cumulative** | >$15/day | Session.cost_spent_usd tracking via update_daily_cost() |
| **Architecture Decisions** | Any structural change | Goal tags contain "architecture", "refactor", or new file creation in core paths |
| **Scope Changes** | Deviation from approved plan | Goal not in original day plan, or goal modified from plan |
| **Hiccups** | Any unexpected situation | error_count > 0, recovery_level >= 2, is_hiccup flag, or unknown state |

#### Checkpoint Data Model

```python
class CheckpointTrigger(Enum):
    UX_CHANGE = "ux_change"

#### CLI Surface for Checkpoints

```bash
# View pending checkpoints
swarm-attack cos checkpoints

# Approve a checkpoint
swarm-attack cos approve <checkpoint-id>

# Approve with notes
swarm-attack cos approve <checkpoint-id> --notes "Proceed with caution"

# Reject/skip a checkpoint
swarm-attack cos reject <checkpoint-id>

# Modify and continue
swarm-attack cos modify <checkpoint-id> --instructions "Use approach B instead"
```

#### Checkpoint CLI Implementation

```python
@cos_group.command("checkpoints")
def list_checkpoints():
    """List pending checkpoints requiring approval."""
    pending = asyncio.run(checkpoint_store.list_pending())

    if not pending:

    ))
    click.echo(f"✗ Checkpoint {checkpoint_id} rejected.")
```

#### Integration with AutopilotRunner

The checkpoint system integrates at the start of `_execute_goal()` as shown in section 2.1. When a checkpoint is pending:

1. Execution pauses with `checkpoint_pending=True`
2. CLI shows pending checkpoints on next `swarm-attack cos status`
3. Human resolves via `swarm-attack cos approve/reject`
4. Next autopilot cycle picks up the resolved checkpoint and continues

#### Integration with CampaignExecutor

```python
class CampaignExecutor:
    async def execute_day(self, campaign: Campaign) -> "DayResult":
        """Execute one day of the campaign."""

        # Check for campaign-level checkpoint (e.g., milestone boundary)
        if self._at_milestone_boundary(campaign):
            checkpoint = await self.checkpoint_system.create_milestone_checkpoint(campaign)
            if not checkpoint.approved:
                campaign.state = CampaignState.PAUSED
                await self.store.save(campaign)
                return DayResult(
                    campaign_id=campaign.campaign_id,
                    day=campaign.current_day,
                    goals_completed=0,
                    cost_usd=0,
                    campaign_progress=self._calculate_progress(campaign),
                    paused_for_checkpoint=True,
                )

        # ... rest of execute_day ...
```

## 3. Phase 8: Hierarchical Error Recovery (P2)

**Shunyu Yao:** "Bounded retry with alternatives. Don't over-engineer - just try a different approach on failure."

**David Dohan:** "Agree. Add circuit breakers at each level. And the human escalation MUST happen within 30 minutes of hitting Level 4."

## 4. Phase 9: Episode Memory + Reflexion + Preference Learning (P3)

### Consensus Decision

**Jerry Liu:** "JSONL episodes with simple retrieval. Don't add embeddings until you have thousands of episodes - heuristic filtering works fine at startup scale."

**Kanjun Qiu:** "Reflexion is key. After each goal, generate a verbal reflection. Store it. Retrieve relevant reflections before future actions. This is cheap and powerful."

**Harrison Chase:** "Make sure episodes are structured. Goal → Actions → Outcome → Reflection. Then you can query any dimension."

**PRD Requirement:** "Track which recommendations I accept vs adjust. Adapt future recommendations based on preferences."

### Future Enhancement: Embeddings

When episode count exceeds ~500 and retrieval quality degrades, add embedding support:
- Generate embeddings for `goal.content + reflection`
- Store in separate `embeddings.npy` file
- Use cosine similarity for retrieval
- This is a drop-in enhancement to `retrieve_relevant()`

### Implementation Tasks (6 issues)

| # | Task | Size | Dependencies |
|---|------|------|--------------|
| 9.1 | Create Episode, Action, Outcome dataclasses with serialization | S | - |
| 9.2 | Implement EpisodeStore with JSONL persistence | M | 9.1 |
| 9.3 | Implement ReflexionEngine.reflect() | M | 9.1 |
| 9.4 | Implement ReflexionEngine.retrieve_relevant() with heuristic scoring | M | 9.2 |
| 9.5 | Integrate with RecoveryManager | M | Phase 8, 9.3, 9.4 |
| 9.6 | Implement PreferenceLearner with checkpoint integration | M | 9.1, 7.7 |

## 5. Phase 10: Multi-Day Campaigns + Weekly Planning (P4)

### Consensus Decision

**Shunyu Yao:** "Backward planning from goal state. Define milestones, then decompose into daily goals. Re-plan only when >30% off track."

**Harrison Chase:** "Add state machine for campaign lifecycle. PLANNING → ACTIVE → PAUSED → COMPLETED/FAILED. Persist everything."

**Jerry Liu:** "Campaign context needs to persist across days. Store in a campaign.json with all state."

**David Dohan:** "Budget caps must be per-campaign AND per-day. Daily cap prevents single-day runaway."

**PRD Requirement (User Story #6):** "I want a weekly planning session that projects forward, not just daily standups that look backward."

## 6. Phase 11: Internal Validation Critics (P5)

### Consensus Decision

**Kanjun Qiu:** "Use diverse critics - one for each quality dimension. They should disagree with each other to surface real issues."

**Harrison Chase:** "Majority voting for approval, but ANY security critic veto blocks. Safety is not a democracy."

**David Dohan:** "Track critic accuracy over time. If a critic is consistently wrong, reduce its weight. But never zero - preserve voice."

### 6.4 Integration Flow

The ValidationLayer integrates at three key points in the pipeline:

#### Spec Pipeline Integration

```python
# In Orchestrator.run_spec_pipeline()
class Orchestrator:
    async def run_spec_pipeline(self, feature_id: str) -> SpecResult:
        spec = await self._generate_spec(feature_id)

        # GATE: Validate before human approval
        validation = await self.validation_layer.validate(
            artifact=spec.content,
            artifact_type="spec",
            artifact_id=feature_id,
        )

        if validation.approved:
            # Auto-advance to approval (human still sees it)
            return SpecResult(
                status="ready_for_approval",
                validation=validation,
                auto_approved=True,
            )
        else:
            # Block and surface issues
            return SpecResult(
                status="needs_revision",
                validation=validation,
                blocking_issues=validation.blocking_issues,
            )
```

#### Code Execution Integration

```python
# In AutopilotRunner._execute_goal()
class AutopilotRunner:
    async def _execute_goal(self, goal: DailyGoal) -> GoalExecutionResult:
        # ... existing execution logic ...

        if goal.linked_feature and result.success:
            # GATE: Validate code before marking complete
            code_diff = await self._get_code_diff(goal.linked_feature)
            validation = await self.validation_layer.validate(
                artifact=code_diff,
                artifact_type="code",
                artifact_id=f"{goal.linked_feature}-{goal.linked_issue}",
            )

            if not validation.approved:
                # Don't mark complete - needs fixes
                return GoalExecutionResult(
                    success=False,
                    error="Validation failed: " + validation.consensus_summary,
                    validation=validation,
                )

        return result
```

#### CLI Validation Command

```bash
# Manual validation check
swarm-attack cos validate spec chief-of-staff-v2
swarm-attack cos validate code swarm_attack/chief_of_staff/
```

```python
# In CLI
@cos_group.command("validate")
@click.argument("artifact_type", type=click.Choice(["spec", "code", "test"]))
@click.argument("path")
def validate_artifact(artifact_type: str, path: str):
    """Run validation critics on an artifact."""
    content = Path(path).read_text()
    result = asyncio.run(validation_layer.validate(content, artifact_type))

    if result.approved:
        click.echo(f"✓ APPROVED: {result.consensus_summary}")
    else:
        click.echo(f"✗ NEEDS REVIEW: {result.consensus_summary}")
        for issue in result.blocking_issues:
            click.echo(f"  - {issue}")
```

#### Gating Rules Summary

| Artifact | Gate Location | Auto-Approve Threshold | Human Required |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Spec | Before `SPEC_NEEDS_APPROVAL` | 60% critic approval | Security veto OR <60% |
| Code | Before goal marked complete | 60% critic approval | Security veto OR <60% |
| Test | Before Verifier runs | 60% critic approval | Coverage <80% |

### Implementation Tasks (6 issues)

| # | Task | Size | Dependencies |
|---|------|------|--------------|
| 11.1 | Create Critic base class and CriticScore | S | - |
| 11.2 | Implement SpecCritic variants | M | 11.1 |
| 11.3 | Implement CodeCritic variants | M | 11.1 |
| 11.4 | Implement TestCritic variants | M | 11.1 |
| 11.5 | Implement ValidationLayer consensus | M | 11.2-11.4 |
| 11.6 | Integrate validation gates into pipelines | M | 11.5, Phase 7 |

## 7. Success Metrics

| Metric | v1 Baseline | v2 Target | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Real execution rate | 0% (stub) | 100% | Goals that call orchestrators |
| Automatic recovery | 0% | 70% | Failures resolved without human |
| Human review reduction | 100% manual | <30% | Artifacts bypassing review |
| Multi-day completion | N/A | >75% | Campaigns finished as planned |
| Learning improvement | None | +10%/month | Goal completion rate trend |
| Cost efficiency | Unmeasured | Track | $/completed goal trend |
| Checkpoint response time | N/A | <30 min avg | Time from checkpoint to resolution |

---

## 8. Risk Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|-------|
| Runaway execution | Per-day + per-campaign budget caps, mandatory checkpoints | David's design |
| Bad learning loops | Bounded weight changes (±10% per update), rollback on degradation | Kanjun's design |
| Infinite recovery | 4-level cap with forced escalation, circuit breakers | Shunyu's design |
| Context bloat | Episode pruning (keep last 100), recency decay | Jerry's design |
| Missed checkpoints | Explicit trigger thresholds including hiccups, default to checkpoint on uncertainty | P0 design |

---

## 9. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 7: Real Execution + Checkpoints (MVP - Do First)
**10 issues** (5 execution + 5 checkpoint)

This is the foundation. Without real execution, v2 is just a more elaborate stub. Checkpoints are P0 - required for collaborative autonomy.

### Phase 8: Hierarchical Recovery (Core Autonomy)
**5 issues**

Enables overnight runs. Combined with Phase 7, you can say "work on this" and trust it to make progress without babysitting.

### Phase 9: Episode Memory + Reflexion + Preferences (Learning)
**6 issues** (5 memory + 1 preference learning)

Cheap investment, high payoff. Every execution makes future executions better. Preference learning satisfies PRD requirement.

### Phase 10: Multi-Day Campaigns + Weekly Planning (Strategic)
**8 issues** (7 campaigns + 1 weekly)

Graduate from "daily tasks" to "build this feature over the week." Weekly planning satisfies PRD User Story #6.

### Phase 11: Internal Validation (Scale)
**6 issues**

Reduces human bottleneck. Most specs/code auto-approve; you only see the hard cases.

**Total: 35 issues across 5 phases**

---

## 10. Expert Panel Final Statement

**Harrison Chase:** "The roadmap is pragmatic. Phase 7 → 8 → 9 builds a solid autonomous agent. Phases 10-11 add strategic capability. Ship Phase 7-9 first, validate, then proceed."

**Jerry Liu:** "Episode memory with simple retrieval is the right call for startup scale. Add embeddings when you have thousands of episodes, not before. Parallel execution can wait for v3."

**Kanjun Qiu:** "Bounded learning is critical. The 4-level recovery and weight caps prevent runaway self-modification. Good safety design. Preference learning from checkpoint decisions is a nice touch."

**David Dohan:** "I'm satisfied with the checkpoint system and escalation paths. The security veto in validation is essential. Don't compromise on that. The human-in-the-loop design with hiccup detection addresses my core concern about autonomous operation."

**Shunyu Yao:** "Simplified recovery is the right call. One alternative on failure, not three. Keep it lean until you have data showing you need more."
