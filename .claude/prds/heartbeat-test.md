# PRD: User Activity Dashboard

## Problem Statement

2. Highlight peak productivity hours
3. Export activity data for personal tracking

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see my daily activity chart

- As a user, I want to export my data as CSV

## Success Metrics

- User engagement > 30% weekly
- Data export success rate > 99%

## Constraints
- Must work offline after initial load
- Cannot store data longer than 30 days
- Mobile-responsive design required
