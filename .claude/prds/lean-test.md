# PRD: User Notifications

## Problem Statement
Users miss important updates in the app. They don't know when something relevant happens unless they manually check.

## Goals
1. Notify users of important events
2. Let users see notification history
3. Allow users to mark notifications as read

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to receive notifications when something important happens
- As a user, I want to see a list of my recent notifications
- As a user, I want to mark notifications as read

## Success Metrics
- Users engage with notifications
- Fewer support tickets about "I didn't know X happened"

## Constraints
- MVP for our 100 beta users
- In-app notifications only (no push/email for v1)
- Use existing user auth system
